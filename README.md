# prayerMate
A mobile application that helps Muslims find the **Qibla direction** and check **daily prayer times** based on their location.  
The app uses the device's **GPS** to detect the user's location accurately, connects to a **Prayer Times API server** to fetch precise timings, and relies on the phone's **magnetic sensors (compass)** to determine the Qibla direction.
